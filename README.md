In this project, we look at the trivial numerical methods for solving non-linear equations, systems of linear- and non-linear equations, finding the dominant eigenvalue of a square matrix. Moreover, we discuss the various interpolation techniques and the elementary algorithms for numerical differentiation and integration.
