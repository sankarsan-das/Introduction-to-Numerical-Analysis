This project provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental numerical methods essential for approximating solutions to various mathematical problems encountered in scientific and engineering disciplines. It delves into the theoretical underpinnings and practical algorithms for solving single and systems of non-linear equations, as well as systems of linear equations. Furthermore, the work explores techniques for determining the dominant eigenvalue of a square matrix, a crucial aspect in many computational applications. The project also covers elementary interpolation methods for approximating functions from discrete data points, alongside basic algorithms for numerical differentiation and integration. The aim is to establish a foundational understanding of these core numerical techniques, emphasizing their utility in situations where analytical solutions are intractable.
